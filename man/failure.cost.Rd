\title{Calculate (random) costs of a failure}
\usage{
failure.cost(diameter, mean = FALSE)

\item{diameter}{diameter [mm]}

\item{mean}{boolan. Should the expected cost be returned? Random otherwise.}
}
\value{
if \code{mean=FALSE}, the cost of failure [CHF] are sampled
randomly. If \code{mean=TRUE}, the expected average costs are returned.
